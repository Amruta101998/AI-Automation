## Module: health_router.py
- **Module Name**: The module is named `health_router.py`.

- **Primary Objectives**: The primary purpose of this module is to provide a health check endpoint for the system. This allows users to verify if the system is up and running. No authentication or authorization is required to access this status.

- **Critical Functions**: The main function in this module is `health()`. This function responds with a "ok" status if the system is up.

- **Key Variables**: The key variable in this module is `status`. This is a field in the `HealthResponse` class, which is set to "ok" by default. 

- **Interdependencies**: This module depends on several packages including `typing`, `fastapi`, and `pydantic`. 

- **Core vs. Auxiliary Operations**: The core operation of this module is to return the system's health status. There are no auxiliary operations in this module.

- **Operational Sequence**: The operational flow is straightforward - when the `/health` endpoint is hit, the `health()` function is invoked, which returns the `HealthResponse` with a status of "ok".

- **Performance Aspects**: Performance considerations are minimal as the module only returns a static response. However, its performance might indirectly indicate the overall performance of the system, as a failure to respond might suggest system downtime.

- **Reusability**: The module is highly reusable. It can be incorporated into any system that requires a health check endpoint.

- **Usage**: This module is used to monitor the health of the system. Users can send a GET request to the `/health` endpoint to receive a "ok" status if the system is up.

- **Assumptions**: The module assumes that the system is in a healthy state by default, as it returns "ok" unless the system is down. It also assumes that the health check will be performed via a GET request to the `/health` endpoint.
