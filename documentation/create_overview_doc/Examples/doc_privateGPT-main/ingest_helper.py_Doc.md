## Module: ingest_helper.py
- **Module Name**: ingest_helper.py

- **Primary Objectives**: The main purpose of this module is to facilitate the ingestion of files into the system. It provides a helper class `IngestHelper` that simplifies the process of file ingestion by abstracting the details of the HTTP request and response validation.

- **Critical Functions**: 
  - `__init__(self, test_client: TestClient)`: This is the constructor of the `IngestHelper` class. It initializes the `test_client` attribute which is used to make HTTP requests.
  - `ingest_file(self, path: Path) -> IngestResponse`: This function ingests a file into the system. It sends a POST request to the "/v1/ingest" endpoint with the file as the request body and validates the response using the `IngestResponse` model.

- **Key Variables**: 
  - `test_client`: This is an instance of `TestClient` used to make HTTP requests.
  - `path`: This is a `Path` object representing the path of the file to be ingested.
  - `files`: This is a dictionary that maps the file name to the file object.
  - `response`: This is the HTTP response received from the "/v1/ingest" endpoint.
  - `ingest_result`: This is an `IngestResponse` object representing the validated response.

- **Interdependencies**: This module interacts with the "/v1/ingest" endpoint of the system. It also depends on the `TestClient` class for making HTTP requests and the `IngestResponse` model for validating the response.

- **Core vs. Auxiliary Operations**: The core operation of the module is the `ingest_file` function which ingests the file into the system. The `__init__` function is an auxiliary operation that sets up the `IngestHelper` instance.

- **Operational Sequence**: The `ingest_file` function is called with the path of the file to be ingested. It sends a POST request to the "/v1/ingest" endpoint with the file as the request body. The response is then validated using the `IngestResponse` model.

- **Performance Aspects**: The performance of this module largely depends on the speed of the HTTP requests and the size of the file being ingested.

- **Reusability**: The `IngestHelper` class is highly reusable as it abstracts the details of the file ingestion process. It can be instantiated with different `TestClient` instances and used to ingest multiple files.

- **Usage**: This module is used in the context of testing the file ingestion functionality of the system. The `IngestHelper` class can be instantiated with a `TestClient` instance and the `ingest_file` function can be called with the path of the file to be ingested.

- **Assumptions**: The module assumes that the "/v1/ingest" endpoint is working correctly and that the `IngestResponse` model accurately represents the expected response. It also assumes that the file to be ingested exists at the given path.
