## Module: embeddings_service.py
- **Module Name**: The module name is `embeddings_service.py`.

- **Primary Objectives**: The main purpose of this module is to provide services related to embeddings. It uses an embedding model to convert a list of texts into their corresponding embeddings.

- **Critical Functions**: 
  - `__init__`: This is the constructor method for the `EmbeddingsService` class. It initializes the embedding model using dependency injection.
  - `texts_embeddings`: This method converts a list of texts into their corresponding embeddings.

- **Key Variables**: 
  - `embedding_model`: This is an instance of the `EmbeddingComponent` class. It is used to generate embeddings for texts.
  - `texts`: This is a list of texts for which embeddings are to be generated.
  - `texts_embeddings`: This is a list of embeddings corresponding to the input texts.

- **Interdependencies**: This module interacts with the `EmbeddingComponent` module to generate embeddings for texts.

- **Core vs. Auxiliary Operations**: The core operation of this module is to generate embeddings for texts. The auxiliary operations include initializing the `EmbeddingComponent` instance and creating `Embedding` objects.

- **Operational Sequence**: The sequence of operations is as follows:
  1. The `EmbeddingsService` class is instantiated.
  2. The `texts_embeddings` method is called with a list of texts.
  3. The `get_text_embedding_batch` method of the `embedding_model` is called to generate embeddings for the texts.
  4. The embeddings are wrapped in `Embedding` objects and returned.

- **Performance Aspects**: The performance of this module depends on the efficiency of the `EmbeddingComponent` and the size of the input texts list. For larger lists, the time taken to generate embeddings will be higher.

- **Reusability**: This module is highly reusable as it provides a service for generating embeddings for any list of texts. It can be used in any context where text embeddings are required.

- **Usage**: This module can be used by instantiating the `EmbeddingsService` class and calling the `texts_embeddings` method with the required list of texts.

- **Assumptions**: The module assumes that the `EmbeddingComponent` is correctly implemented and that the input texts are in a format that can be processed by the `EmbeddingComponent`.
