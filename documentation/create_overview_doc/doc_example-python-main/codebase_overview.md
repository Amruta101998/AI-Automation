Summary: The provided codebase represents a simple program with two main components, represented as nodes in the code flow. 

The first component is the "global" function, which acts as the main entry point for the system. It's represented by the node with the uid "node_97df105c". This function is responsible for initiating the process and controlling the overall flow of the program.

The second component is the "say_hello" function, represented by the node with the uid "node_f50b804a". This function is tasked with outputting a greeting. The "global" function calls the "say_hello" function, indicating that the greeting task is a part of the overall process controlled by the "global" function.

The flow of the program is linear and straightforward, beginning with the "global" function and moving to the "say_hello" function. This simple structure makes the system easy to understand and manage. 

The flow map and codebase flow map provide a visual representation of this process, further simplifying the understanding of the system's structure and flow.

## Code Flow Documentation

The provided JSON defines a directed graph that represents the flow of code in a program. There are two nodes in this graph, representing two functions or modules in the program, and one edge that describes the interaction between these nodes.

At a high level, the code flow is as follows:

1. The system starts at the "global" function, which is the main entry point of the program. This function is represented by the node with the uid "node_97df105c". 

2. From the "global" function, the system moves to the "say_hello" function. This function is represented by the node with the uid "node_f50b804a". The interaction between these two functions is represented by the directed edge from "node_97df105c" to "node_f50b804a".

In terms of the modules:

- The "global" module serves as the main entry point of the system. It is responsible for initiating the process and controlling the overall flow of the program.

- The "say_hello" module is responsible for a specific task within the system, which is to output a greeting. It is called from the "global" module, indicating that this task is part of the overall process controlled by the "global" module.

This code flow is straightforward and linear, with one module calling another in a sequence. It provides a clear and simple structure for the system, making it easy to understand and manage.
