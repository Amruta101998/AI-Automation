## Code Flow Documentation

The provided JSON defines a directed graph that represents the flow of code in a program. There are two nodes in this graph, representing two functions or modules in the program, and one edge that describes the interaction between these nodes.

At a high level, the code flow is as follows:

1. The system starts at the "global" function, which is the main entry point of the program. This function is represented by the node with the uid "node_97df105c". 

2. From the "global" function, the system moves to the "say_hello" function. This function is represented by the node with the uid "node_f50b804a". The interaction between these two functions is represented by the directed edge from "node_97df105c" to "node_f50b804a".

In terms of the modules:

- The "global" module serves as the main entry point of the system. It is responsible for initiating the process and controlling the overall flow of the program.

- The "say_hello" module is responsible for a specific task within the system, which is to output a greeting. It is called from the "global" module, indicating that this task is part of the overall process controlled by the "global" module.

This code flow is straightforward and linear, with one module calling another in a sequence. It provides a clear and simple structure for the system, making it easy to understand and manage.
