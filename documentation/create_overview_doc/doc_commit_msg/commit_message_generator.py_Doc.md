## Module: commit_message_generator.py
- **Module Name**: commit_message_generator.py

- **Primary Objectives**: This Python module is designed to generate a commit message based on the difference of changes in a git repository. This is done by using the Bito CLI commands to process the diff output.

- **Critical Functions**: 
    - `generate_commit_message(repo_path, prompt_path)`: This function generates the commit message. It runs the git diff command, writes the output to a file, processes the output using Bito CLI commands, writes the commit message to a file, and then removes the diff output file.
    - `parse_arguments()`: This function parses command line arguments for the repository path and the prompt file path.
    - `main()`: This is the main function that parses the arguments, generates the commit message, and then prints the commit message.

- **Key Variables**: 
    - `repo_path`: Path to the git repository.
    - `prompt_path`: Path to the prompt file.
    - `diff_output`: Output of the git diff command.
    - `bito_output`: Output of the Bito CLI command.
    - `commit_message`: Generated commit message.

- **Interdependencies**: This module interacts with the git system on the host machine and Bito CLI commands.

- **Core vs. Auxiliary Operations**: 
    - Core operations include generating the diff output, processing it using Bito CLI commands, and generating the commit message.
    - Auxiliary operations include writing the diff output and the commit message to files, and removing the diff output file.

- **Operational Sequence**: The module first parses the command line arguments, then generates the diff output, processes it, generates the commit message, writes it to a file, removes the diff output file, and finally prints the commit message.

- **Performance Aspects**: The performance of this module largely depends on the size of the diff output and the efficiency of the Bito CLI commands.

- **Reusability**: This module can be reused in any project that uses git for version control and requires automated generation of commit messages based on the diff of changes.

- **Usage**: This module is used by running it from the command line and providing the required arguments for the repository path and the prompt file path.

- **Assumptions**: 
    - It assumes that the git repository and the prompt file exist at the provided paths.
    - It assumes that the git and Bito CLI commands can be run on the host machine.
    - It assumes that the diff output can be written to and removed from a file in the repository path.
