# Introduction :

The `commit_message_generator.py` is a sophisticated Python module that forms an integral part of our system. The primary purpose of this module is to automate the generation of commit messages based on the differential changes made in a git repository. 

The module works in sync with the Bito Command Line Interface (CLI) commands. The Bito CLI commands are responsible for processing the 'diff' output, which essentially represents the changes made to the codebase. This processed information is then passed on to the `commit_message_generator.py` module.

The module leverages this information to generate a concise and informative commit message. The commit message generated provides a clear and precise overview of the changes that have been made, thus improving the code's readability and maintainability. 

In essence, the `commit_message_generator.py` module aims to streamline the version control process, enhance productivity, and minimize the possibility of human error in documenting code changes. It's a testament to our commitment to automating and improving the software development lifecycle.

# Module Overview
## Module: commit_message_generator.py
- **Module Name**: commit_message_generator.py

- **Primary Objectives**: This Python module is designed to generate a commit message based on the difference of changes in a git repository. This is done by using the Bito CLI commands to process the diff output.

- **Critical Functions**: 
    - `generate_commit_message(repo_path, prompt_path)`: This function generates the commit message. It runs the git diff command, writes the output to a file, processes the output using Bito CLI commands, writes the commit message to a file, and then removes the diff output file.
    - `parse_arguments()`: This function parses command line arguments for the repository path and the prompt file path.
    - `main()`: This is the main function that parses the arguments, generates the commit message, and then prints the commit message.

- **Key Variables**: 
    - `repo_path`: Path to the git repository.
    - `prompt_path`: Path to the prompt file.
    - `diff_output`: Output of the git diff command.
    - `bito_output`: Output of the Bito CLI command.
    - `commit_message`: Generated commit message.

- **Interdependencies**: This module interacts with the git system on the host machine and Bito CLI commands.

- **Core vs. Auxiliary Operations**: 
    - Core operations include generating the diff output, processing it using Bito CLI commands, and generating the commit message.
    - Auxiliary operations include writing the diff output and the commit message to files, and removing the diff output file.

- **Operational Sequence**: The module first parses the command line arguments, then generates the diff output, processes it, generates the commit message, writes it to a file, removes the diff output file, and finally prints the commit message.

- **Performance Aspects**: The performance of this module largely depends on the size of the diff output and the efficiency of the Bito CLI commands.

- **Reusability**: This module can be reused in any project that uses git for version control and requires automated generation of commit messages based on the diff of changes.

- **Usage**: This module is used by running it from the command line and providing the required arguments for the repository path and the prompt file path.

- **Assumptions**: 
    - It assumes that the git repository and the prompt file exist at the provided paths.
    - It assumes that the git and Bito CLI commands can be run on the host machine.
    - It assumes that the diff output can be written to and removed from a file in the repository path.
