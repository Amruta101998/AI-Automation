# High-Level Documentation Generator

This tool is designed to simplify the process of creating high-level documentation for your project directory. It generates detailed information for each module, creates visual flow maps to visualize code execution paths, logs usage metrics, and aggregates all generated documentation into a comprehensive format.

## Features

- **AI Enhanced Module Analysis**: Leverages an AI-driven process to analyze each module, using a user-editable prompt high_level_doc_prompt.txt from the AI_Prompts directory. You can adjust the prompt to obtain a variety of module insights such as:
   - Module Name
   - Primary Objectives
   - Key Functions and Roles
   - Important Variables
   - Interactions with Other System Parts
   - Main vs. Supportive Operations
   - Operational Sequence
   - Performance Factors
   - Reusability and Adaptability

- **Auto-Retry Logic**: Incorporates a retry mechanism to ensure the bito command executes successfully, especially in environments where intermittent failures may occur. This feature attempts to run bito up to five times with a delay between retries, improving the chances of successful documentation generation.

- **Visualization with Mermaid.js Flow Maps**: Utilizes AI to generate Mermaid.js scripts that graphically represent module interactions and the flow of code. While the tool has been tested with Python, C, C++, Java, JavaScript, Go, Rust, Ruby, PHP, and Bash, you are encouraged to experiment with other languages as well.

- **Mermaid CLI Image Conversion**: Employs the Mermaid CLI to convert Mermaid.js diagrams into images. This feature provides a graphical depiction of the code architecture, enhancing the visual appeal and readability of the documentation.

- **Skippable Files and Directories**: The tool ignores specific files and directories by default, such as logs, node_modules, .gradle, and more. Adjust the skip list in the script to suit your project needs.

- **Code2Flow Flow Map**: Generates a Full System Flow Map in PNG format using code2flow. Please note that while we can document multiple languages, code2flow flowmap generation supports only Python, JavaScript, Ruby, and PHP.

- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Generates documentation from each module into an overarching markdown file.

- **Documentation Metrics Logging**: Records Bito usage in the form of word and character counts for each module in the bito_usage_log.txt file.

- **Required Tool and File Verification**: The script checks for necessary tools and files before starting.

## Supported Languages

### Code Documentation
Our code documentation tool is designed with flexibility in mind. It currently includes built-in support for Python, C, C++, Java, JavaScript, Go, Rust, Ruby, PHP, and Bash. However, it's also easily extensible to other programming languages. 

To add support for a new language, simply add the file extension to the following line in the code extraction prompt:

```bash
module_files=$(find "$folder_to_document" -type f \( -name '*.py' -o -name '*.c' -o -name '*.cpp' -o -name '*.java' -o -name '*.js' -o -name '*.go' -o -name '*.rs' -o -name '*.rb' -o -name '*.php' -o -name '*.sh' \))
```

### Flowmaps
While our tool is versatile in creating code documentation for Python, C, C++, Java, JavaScript, Go, Rust, Ruby, PHP, and Bash, and more, the code2flow Full System Flow Map feature currently supports Python, JavaScript, Ruby, and PHP.

## Prerequisites

Ensure the following tools are installed:

- `bito` : https://github.com/gitbito/CLI

- `code2flow` : https://pypi.org/project/code2flow/

- `dot` : https://graphviz.org/download/

- `mermaidcli` : https://github.com/mermaid-js/mermaid-cli

Also, make sure these prompt files are present in a specified prompt folder (`AI_Prompts` by default):

- `high_level_doc_prompt.txt`
- `system_summary_prompt.txt`
- `mermaid_doc_prompt.txt`

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. **Set Execution Permissions**: Provide the necessary execution permissions to the script:
   ```bash
   chmod +x createdoc.sh
   ```
3. **Run the Script**: Execute the script by providing the folder you wish to document as an argument:
   ```bash
   ./createdoc.sh <folder_to_document>
   ```

## Output

Upon successful execution, the tool generates a directory named doc_<folder_name>

The directory includes:

- Module Documentation: Individual markdown files for each module, titled <module_name>_Documentation.md, detailing the module's purpose, functions, and interactions.

- Aggregated Documentation: A comprehensive markdown file High_Level_Doc.md, which consolidates the documentation from each module. This file also includes SVG format flow maps created by Mermaid.js for a visual overview of module interactions, and a final Full System Flow Map in PNG format generated by code2flow for a broader system perspective.

<!-- TODO Next Update
 - A summarized system documentation which explains the overall system's flow and functionality. -->

## Skip List

Certain directories and files are skipped during the documentation process. This includes commonly ignored directories like `node_modules`, `logs`, etc., and files with extensions like `.json`, etc. You can update the skip list within the script as per your requirements.
