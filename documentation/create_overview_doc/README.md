# Documentation Generation Automation

When we reached out to our users, many appreciated our documentation generation automation script. However, the majority expressed the desire for a more enhanced solution. Specifically, users outlined the following requirements:

- Describe, at a high level, the purpose of a given code folder or module.
- Provide a high-level flow of the code within the provided folder or module.
- Generate documentation based on the code flow, covering modules, classes, functions, and more.
- Offer comprehensive documentation for all required components within the folder or module.

The overarching aim is to provide a document that offers both an onboarding resource and a high-level perspective of how the code functions, transcending simple file-based documentation.

> **Note:** Initially, our solution will focus on languages supported by the `code2flow` CLI on Linux.

## TODO

- Restrict documentation to code files containing less than 250K characters, aligning with the processing capabilities of our current LLM models.
- Support Mixed Languages Per Folder/Module.
- Squish Bugs.

## Enhanced Features

- Recursive Documentation: The improved script will traverse and document the codebase recursively, replicating the file structure. The end result will be a `codebase_overview.md` file, offering a panoramic view of the entire system.
- Docstring Extraction: Our solution will extract docstrings from both Python and JavaScript files.
- Code Flow Visualization: We will incorporate the `code2flow` tool to graphically represent code flow via flow maps.

## Script Details

We've crafted an advanced Bash script that satisfies these needs. The script's key operations include:

1. Verification of required CLI tools.
2. Recursive replication of directory structures.
3. Extraction and documentation of Python and JavaScript docstrings.
4. Compilation of module overviews.
5. Creation of a comprehensive codebase overview.

## Running the Enhanced Script

To deploy the documentation generation automation script, proceed as follows:

1. Permission Setup: Ensure the script has execution permissions. This is achievable with:

```
chmod +x createdoc.sh
```

2. Execution: Initiate the documentation procedure with:

```
./createdoc.sh [TargetFolderName] -[languageOption]
```

Where:
- `[TargetFolderName]` should be replaced with the folder or module you're documenting.
- `[languageOption]` accepts `-py` for Python and `-js` for JavaScript.

For instance, to document a Python project named `DesertedIslandGame`, use:

```
./createdoc.sh DesertedIslandGame -py
```

3. Output: Documentation, mirroring the input codebase's structure, will be stored in a prefixed folder (e.g., `doc_DesertedIslandGame`). Essential documents include:
   - `codebase_overview.md`: This gives an encompassing look at the entire system.
   - Overviews for individual modules and files.

## Dependencies

Ensure tools and CLIs like `bito`, `code2flow`, `dot` (for Graphviz), and `jq` (for JSON parsing) are installed. The script validates these prerequisites before execution.

## Modifying the Script for Additional Languages

Though the script predominantly supports Python and JavaScript, it can be expanded to accommodate more languages. The modification steps and pertinent code sections are:

(Your steps 1-7 can be included here, preferably in a list format.)

## Why These Changes?

- File Type Constants: To direct the script on which files to process.
- `check_tools` Function: To guarantee the required tools for the new language are available.
- Docstring Extraction: Different languages possess unique comment or docstring syntax. Thus, language-specific functions are imperative.
- Functions `extract_docstrings` & `aggregate_file_summaries`: These functions handle file processing. Modifying them ensures the new language's files are incorporated during documentation.
- `generate_module_overview` Function: This tailors documentation based on the module's language.
- Additional Dependencies: Some languages may necessitate distinct tools or libraries for documentation generation or code structure understanding.

## Conclusion

Augmenting our script with additional language support necessitates a clear comprehension of its existing architecture. Through detailed instructions, we aim to facilitate seamless integrations for contributors. Looking ahead, refactoring the script for more modular and streamlined language additions would be advantageous.

## End Note

This enhancement is pivotal for enriching user experiences, assisting them in onboarding and deciphering their codebases more effectively. Team collaboration is the linchpin to the successful rollout of these improvements.
