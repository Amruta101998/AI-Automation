# High-Level Documentation Generator

This powerful tool streamlines the creation of high-level documentation for software project directories. It analyzes code modules, generates visual flow maps, and compiles comprehensive documentation, all while keeping track of usage metrics.

## Features

- **AI Enhanced Module Analysis**: Leverages an AI-driven process to analyze each module, using a user-editable prompt high_level_doc_prompt.txt from the AI_Prompts directory. You can adjust the prompt to obtain a variety of module insights such as:
   - Module Name
   - Primary Objectives
   - Key Functions and Roles
   - Important Variables
   - Interactions with Other System Parts
   - Main vs. Supportive Operations
   - Operational Sequence
   - Performance Factors
   - Reusability and Adaptability
   - Usage
   - Assumptions

- **Auto-Retry Logic and Enhanced Error Handling**: Sophisticated error handling and retry mechanisms ensure reliable documentation generation in unstable environments.

- **Visualization with Mermaid.js Flow Maps and Enhanced Syntax Handling**: AI-generated Mermaid.js scripts graphically represent module interactions, now with enhanced handling and validation of Mermaid diagram syntax. 

- **Mermaid CLI Image Conversion**: Converts Mermaid.js diagrams into images for a visual representation of the code architecture.

- **Skippable Files and Directories**: Customizable skip list to ignore specific files and directories during documentation.

- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Generates detailed markdown files for each module and compiles them into an overarching High_Level_Doc, complete with visual flow maps. 

- **Documentation Metrics Logging**: Records the token usage of the bito command, converting word counts to token counts for accurate usage metrics. Data is logged in bito_usage_log.txt.

- **Required Tool and File Verification**: Checks for the presence of necessary tools ("bito", "mmdc") and prompt files before starting the documentation process.

## Supported Languages

Supports Python, C, C++, Java, JavaScript, Go, Rust, Ruby, PHP, and Bash, and is extensible to other languages.

To add support for a new language, simply add the file extension to the following line in the code extraction prompt:

```bash
module_files=$(find "$folder_to_document" -type f \( -name '*.py' -o -name '*.c' -o -name '*.cpp' -o -name '*.java' -o -name '*.js' -o -name '*.go' -o -name '*.rs' -o -name '*.rb' -o -name '*.php' -o -name '*.sh' \))
```

## Prerequisites

Ensure the following tools are installed:

- `bito` : https://github.com/gitbito/CLI

- `mermaidcli` : https://github.com/mermaid-js/mermaid-cli

Also, make sure these prompt files are present in a specified prompt folder (`AI_Prompts` by default):

- `high_level_doc_prompt.txt`
- `mermaid_doc_prompt.txt`
- `system_introduction_prompt.txt`
- `system_overview_mermaid_update_prompt.txt`

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. **Set Execution Permissions**: Provide the necessary execution permissions to the script:
   ```bash
   chmod +x createdoc.sh
   ```
3. **Run the Script**: Execute the script by providing the folder you wish to document as an argument:
   ```bash
   ./createdoc.sh <folder_to_document>
   ```

## Output

Upon successful execution, the tool generates a directory named doc_<folder_name>

The directory includes:

- Module Documentation: Individual markdown files for each module, titled <module_name>_Doc.md, detailing the module's purpose, functions, and interactions.

- Aggregated Documentation: A comprehensive markdown file High_Level_Doc.md, which consolidates the documentation from each module. This file also includes SVG format flow maps created by Mermaid.js for a visual overview of module interactions, and a final Full System Flow Map in PNG format generated by code2flow for a broader system perspective.

## Skip List
Adjustable list of directories and files to be skipped during documentation, including common directories like node_modules and logs.

### Updating the Skip List

Customizing the Skip List is straightforward and can be tailored to suit the unique needs of your project. Follow these steps to modify the Skip List:

1. **Accessing the Script**:
   - Open the `createdoc.sh` in your preferred text editor.

2. **Locating the Skip Logic**:
   - Navigate to the `is_skippable` function within the script. This function contains the logic for determining which files and directories are skipped.

3. **Modifying the Skip Array**:
   - Inside the `is_skippable` function, find the `skip_dirs_files` array. This array holds the patterns for files and directories that are currently set to be skipped.
   - Modify this array to include or exclude specific directories and file patterns as per your project requirements. 
     - To add a new pattern, simply append a new string to the array.
     - To remove an existing pattern, delete the corresponding string from the array.

4. **Saving Changes**:
   - After adjusting the `skip_dirs_files` array, save the script file.

5. **Re-running the Script**:
   - Execute the script again to apply the updated skip list for your documentation generation process.

By customizing the Skip List, you can ensure that the documentation generated by the tool is relevant and concise, focusing only on the parts of your project that require documentation.
