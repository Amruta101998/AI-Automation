## Module: file_handler.py
- **Module Name**: The module's name is `file_handler.py`.

- **Primary Objectives**: The main purpose of this module is to open a file using the default system handler. It is a simple utility for file handling operations.

- **Critical Functions**: 
  - `open_file(path)`: This is the main function of the module. It takes a file path as an argument and opens the file using the system's default file handler.

- **Key Variables**: 
  - `path`: This is the main variable in the module. It is a string that holds the path to the file to be opened.

- **Interdependencies**: This module depends on the `os` module for interacting with the operating system.

- **Core vs. Auxiliary Operations**: The core operation of this module is to open a file. There are no auxiliary operations in this module.

- **Operational Sequence**: The module begins by importing the `os` module. Then it defines the `open_file(path)` function. When this function is called with a file path as an argument, it opens the file using the system's default file handler.

- **Performance Aspects**: The performance of this module depends on the performance of the `os.system()` function. If the system's default file handler is slow, this will slow down the `open_file(path)` function.

- **Reusability**: This module is highly reusable. The `open_file(path)` function can be used in any Python program that needs to open a file. However, it should be noted that this function uses the `os.system()` function, which is not recommended for use in production code because it can be a security hazard. If you plan to reuse this function in production code, consider replacing `os.system()` with a safer alternative.
