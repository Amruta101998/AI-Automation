Sure, here is the consolidated Mermaid Markdown diagram:

```mermaid

    A[User] -->|Provide Credentials| B(SpotifyOAuth)
    B -->|Authenticate| C{Spotipy Object}
    C --> D[Get User]
    C --> E[Adjust Volume]
    C --> F[Play/Pause]
    C --> G[Next Song]
    C --> H[Previous Song]
    D --> I[User Info]
    E --> J[Volume Info]
    F --> K[Playback Info]
    G --> L[Next Track Info]
    H --> M[Previous Track Info]
```

This diagram represents a user interacting with Spotify via an OAuth authentication process. After successful authentication, the user can control various aspects of their Spotify experience including user information, volume control, playback control, and song selection.
